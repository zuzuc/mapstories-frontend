    image: cmWhy,
    text: "Climate change is resulting in rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, increased drought, crop failure, soil salination, and increased extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a response people are likely to be displaced or to decide to migrate or relocate.  ",

    image: cmWho,
    text: "Climate change is disproportionately affecting the poorest regions of the world. Small island nations such as Fiji in the South Pacific are likely to be submerged at 2 degrees warming. Increased temperatures in African regions such as the Horn of Africa have already produced acute. drought. ",

    image: cmWhere,
    text: "Tabloid representations sow fear-mongering predictions that climate refugees will flee to Europe and North America. However, reports from the IDMC show that the majority of climate-induced migration has so far occurred within people´s own countries (No Matter of Choice, 2018).",

    image: cmNoRefugees,
    text: "The 1951 Refugee Convention defines a refugee as a person who has fled conflict, war, or persecution and who has crossed an international border to find safety in another country (UNHCR, ‘Refugees’). At present, those displaced from their home due to climate change have no legal access to asylum in foreign nations.",

    image: cmII,
    text: "Internal or illegal: In 2019, the IDMC recorded 23.9 million displacements due to meteorological disaster, such as floods, drought, and wildfire. Those displaced were not recognised as climate refugees. Each year, many people are forced to remain in unsafe nations or risk criminalisation crossing borders. ",

    text: "Top-down approaches often obscure ‘the voices of the people whose mobilities are/may be affected in the context of climate change` (Nash, ‘Knowing Human Mobility […]`, 2018, p. 78). Hence, it is essential that affected people can share their own perspectives. ",
